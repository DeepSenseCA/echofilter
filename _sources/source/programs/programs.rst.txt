CLI Reference
=============

These pages describe the various arguments for the command line interface
of the :ref:`echofilter CLI` program, which performs the inference
process of generating entrained-air, seafloor, and surface lines for an input
Echoview EV or CSV file.

Additionally, we provide documentation for the :ref:`ev2csv CLI` utility program,
which can be used to convert EV files to raw CSV files,
the training script :ref:`echofilter-train`,
and the script :ref:`echofilter-generate-shards` which converts raw data to
the format to use for the training process.
